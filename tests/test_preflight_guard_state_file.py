"""Preflight guards must key on the v4 state file (ISSUE-250).

v4 moved configuration detection to .sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml.
Nothing in the onboarding path (skills/setup, skills/_features) creates
phase.yaml — small_story_controller writes it lazily on the first story
workflow. A guard that gates solely on phase.yaml therefore refuses to run
on a correctly configured, freshly onboarded project.
