WI-017 S7 — Wiring: close the dead-end at the system level.

Tests the behaviors specified in tests/features/wi-017-s7-wiring.feature.

Pre-S7 state that makes these tests RED:
- capability `migrate.typed_legacy_backlog` is supported: false, supports_project_shapes: []
- project_shape `typed_legacy_backlog` has migrate_allowed: false and routes to
  compatibility-mode (a no-action dead-end)
- recover_project _blocked_actions HARD-BLOCKS "taxonomy-migration" for the
  unsupported-typed-backlog-layout failure
- A typed-legacy project's guard status offers NO runnable migrate action
- Doctor maintenance-route for a typed-legacy project returns compatibility-mode
  with primary_action="continue-compatibility-mode" (no migration offered)

After S7 these tests must be GREEN.
