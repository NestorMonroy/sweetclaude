"""Test-file freezing is actually enforced (ISSUE-282).

`rules/tdd-levels.md` promised "test files are immutable during
implementation". The guardian hook checked for `tdd_phase: implementing` and
nothing in the repo ever wrote that value, so the block never fired. The rule
had never once been enforced.

The existing hook tests passed throughout, because they wrote `tdd_phase`
into their own fixtures — correct logic, verified against input the system
never produced. That is the specific failure this file is written to avoid,
so **no test here hand-writes the marker.** Every one drives
`scripts/tdd_phase.py`, which is what `skills/code-tdd/SKILL.md` invokes.

The honest limit: a test cannot make the model follow a skill. What is proven
here is that the mechanism the skill calls produces the enforcement it claims.
Whether the model calls it is a behavioural question, and belongs to the
external-judge harness.
