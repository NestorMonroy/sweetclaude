# SweetClaude Large-Story Stop Guard Hook (Track C TASK-C4)
# Stop — blocks session end while a large-story workflow is active and
# non-terminal, surfacing a one-line status summary. A deliberate second stop
# (stop_hook_active) confirms an intentional pause and is recorded to disk,
# fingerprinted to the workflow's material state; later turns then stop
# silently until the story progresses (re-arming one reminder) or goes
# terminal. This prevents the block re-firing on every turn of a paused story.
#
# Protocol: block = exit 0 + {"decision":"block","reason":...}; allow = silent.
