"""Report which protections cannot run, and why.

Three protections turned out to be switched off with no signal at all — the
work-in-progress limit, the phase-dwelling guard, and test-file immutability.
Each disabled itself because the state it needed was unreadable, allowed
whatever was happening, and said nothing. Allowing looked identical to
approving.

The specific causes are fixed. This exists so the next one is visible on the
day it happens rather than months later.

Checking at session start rather than plumbing a notice through every hook is
deliberate. There are 122 early-exit paths across the hooks; instrumenting each
would be fragile and easy to forget in a new one. A single check that asks
"could this protection run right now?" catches a newly broken protection
whether or not anyone remembered to instrument it, and reports before the
protection is needed instead of after it silently skipped.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/protection_status.py --project-dir .
    python3 scripts/protection_status.py --project-dir . --format json
