"""Report skill outcomes from the metrics log (ISSUE-276).

`.sweetclaude/metrics/events.log` recorded that skills ran and never whether
they worked. This pairs invocations with completions and reports the result.

Three properties this is built around:

  * An invocation with no completion is reported as `unknown`, never as a
    success. Silence is not evidence of working, and treating it as such is
    how a log that logs nothing useful still reads as green.
  * A skill that has never been observed at all is `unobserved`, which is a
    different statement from "zero failures". 113 of the framework's skills
    had never appeared in this project's log.
  * Historic events written before outcomes existed are `unknown`, and are
    distinguishable from a completion that recorded `unknown` deliberately.

The log is append-only YAML documents, so outcome cannot be attached to the
invocation record after the fact. It rides on a paired `skill_completed`
event instead.

Usage:
