# Large-Story and Small-Story Workflows

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-06-10

These are SweetClaude's two controller-gated, evidence-based work item workflows.
They run a work item through the full sequence — DEFINE, DESIGN, PLAN, IMPLEMENT,
VERIFY, SHIP/closeout — with phase progression enforced by a controller and a set
of hooks rather than by Claude's own judgment. The point is that a story cannot be
declared done on the basis of how the output looks. It is done only when the
controller has recorded evidence against the criteria that were locked in up front.

---

## You Don't Invoke These Directly

Both workflows are internal. You do not call `/sweetclaude:large-story` or
`/sweetclaude:small-story` yourself. You start work the normal way — describe what
you want in natural language to `/sweetclaude:go`. SweetClaude classifies the
request and, when the work warrants it, routes into one of these workflows.

From your seat, the experience is the same as any other SweetClaude work: you talk
through what the story is, you approve the success criteria, you do the
implementation work together, and at the end SweetClaude reports completion. What
is different is underneath — the controller is recording state, gating each phase,
and refusing to let the story close until the evidence is in place. You feel that
mostly as a sequence that cannot be rushed, not as extra ceremony.

## The Phase Sequence and Its Gates

Both workflows run the same phases in the same order:

```text
DEFINE → DESIGN → PLAN → [ENFORCEMENT CHECK] → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → SHIP
```

Each transition goes through the controller. The controller is the single writer
of workflow state — Claude never edits the state files directly. The gate hook
denies direct writes to `.sweetclaude/state/` and `.sweetclaude/reports/`, so the
only way forward is through a controller command that returns success.

What each gate enforces:

- **DEFINE** — The story objective, expected outcomes, and non-goals are agreed
  with you, and a success-criteria contract is created and frozen. Criteria must
  be binary and machine- or test-measurable; open-ended, human-judged criteria are
  rejected here and routed to backlog instead. Once the contract is frozen and the
  workflow is initialized, the contract is human-gated — any later edit raises an
  approval prompt that only you can answer, in every permission mode.
- **DESIGN** and **PLAN** — Durable design and plan artifacts are written, each
  bound to the frozen contract. PLAN will not enter if the design artifact is not
  bound to the contract; IMPLEMENT will not enter if the plan artifact is not bound
  to the contract.
- **ENFORCEMENT CHECK** — Before IMPLEMENT, the controller confirms the gate hook
  is actually loaded. It arms a probe, allows one expected write, blocks one
  forbidden write, then checks the result. If enforcement is not verified live, the
  workflow stops here and refuses to enter IMPLEMENT — it will not run unprotected
  where the evidence gate cannot be trusted.
- **IMPLEMENT** — Only after IMPLEMENT is entered can project files be created or
  modified. In every other phase the gate hook denies project writes. As you work,
  an evidence hook automatically records the files touched and commands run. That
  evidence cannot be fabricated; it comes from observed activity.
- **VERIFY** — The controller regenerates the implementation record from observed
  evidence and writes the canonical ledger. It **fails closed**: if any criterion
  lacks evidence, or if no implementation evidence was observed at all, verification
  does not pass.
- **SHIP** — Closeout is written by the controller only after completion validation
  passes. Terminal "done" state is written by the controller, never by Claude.

You cannot skip ahead. If you try to move to a phase whose gate is not satisfied,
the controller returns a block, Claude reports the reason, and the workflow stays
where it is. There is no working around a block by retrying with different
arguments — the SKILL explicitly forbids that.

See [Phases and Workflows](phases-and-workflows.md) for how phases and gates work
across all of SweetClaude.

## Success-Criteria Contracts and Evidence

The contract is the spine of both workflows. During DEFINE, SweetClaude generates a
schema-valid contract skeleton, fills it in with the agreed objective, outcomes,
non-goals, and the binary pass/fail conditions for each criterion, then freezes it.
Freezing computes a contract hash. From that point on, every downstream phase
artifact is bound to that hash, and any edit to the frozen contract is detected as
stale.

Completion is not a judgment call. It requires a `success-criteria-ledger.json`
that evaluates every frozen criterion against accepted evidence and reports a single
binary outcome: `all_success_criteria_passed == true` or `false`. No review,
caucus, verification, or release step may add new completion criteria after the
contract is frozen. If a reviewer finds a real issue outside the frozen criteria,
it routes to backlog, a contract-amendment request, a split story, or human
escalation — it does not silently become a new blocker.

Because the ledger is written by the controller from recorded evidence, and because
VERIFY fails closed without that evidence, SweetClaude cannot claim a story is
complete on the strength of how the result looks. Screenshots and app behavior do
not count as completion evidence unless the controller has entered them into the
ledger.

[Evidence and Success-Criteria Contracts](evidence-and-contracts.md).

## How the Controller Stops You From Skipping Ahead

The controllers (`large_story_controller.py` and `small_story_controller.py`) and
their hooks are the enforcement layer — not the skill text. Three behaviors are
worth knowing as a user:

- **The gate hook** denies project writes outside a controller-entered IMPLEMENT
  phase, and denies direct writes to controller-owned state and reports. So you
  literally cannot start changing code before the workflow has reached IMPLEMENT
  through the gates.
- **The evidence hook** records implementation evidence (touched files, commands)
  automatically during IMPLEMENT. This is what VERIFY reads.
- **The stop guard hook** blocks the session from ending while the workflow is
  non-terminal, and re-injects the controller's status so the open workflow is not
  silently abandoned.

The user-visible effect is simple: the workflow advances one gated step at a time,
the order is fixed, and "done" is something the controller grants, not something
Claude asserts.

## Large vs Small

Both workflows run the identical controller-gated sequence, freeze a contract, bind
downstream artifacts to its hash, record evidence, and fail closed at VERIFY. The
difference is what kind of work each is meant for:

- **Large story** is for a work item that is too large or high-risk for a single
  bounded `/sweetclaude:code-feature`, `/sweetclaude:code-issue`, or
  `/sweetclaude:code-tdd` pass. This is the high-rigor path. SweetClaude's process
  controls anchor the frozen, hash-bound success-criteria contract requirement to
  large/high-rigor work specifically — large-story is where that contract discipline
  is mandatory before any downstream planning, design, implementation, review, or
  release begins.
- **Small story** is for bounded work items that benefit from controller-enforced
  phase gates and evidence recording but are lighter in rigor — the kind of
  contained, single-session work where you still want the gate, the evidence trail,
  and the fail-closed VERIFY, without treating the item as a high-risk
  initiative.

Both keep their own workflow state. Large story stores state under
`.sweetclaude/state/large-story.yaml` (or
`.sweetclaude/state/workflows/{workflow_id}.yaml`); small story uses
`.sweetclaude/state/small-story.yaml` (or the same per-workflow path). See
[State and Memory](state-and-memory.md) for how SweetClaude persists work across
sessions.

## When SweetClaude Uses Each

You don't choose between them directly — you describe the work and SweetClaude
routes. As a rough mental model:

- A substantial or risky feature, or anything you'd otherwise break into multiple
  passes, lands in **large story** — the high-rigor, contract-anchored path.
- A contained piece of work that fits in a single bounded session, but that you
  still want gated and evidenced, lands in **small story**.

Either way, the contract is agreed with you up front, the phases are gated, the
evidence is recorded as you go, and completion is granted by the controller against
that evidence — not asserted from how the output looks.
